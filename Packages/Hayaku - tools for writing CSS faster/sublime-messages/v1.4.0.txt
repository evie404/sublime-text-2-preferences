Two new major features in Hayaku:

1. Value Cycling.
2. User-defined dictionaries.



Value Cycling
-------------

You can now use `alt ↓` and `alt ↑` to cycle any numbers, dates or CSS values.

While there are other plugins doing similar thing, Hayaku excells at it:

- You don't need to place a cursor at the number.
  Hayaku finds the closest number to the cursor in the line and changes it.

  Try it there: `43, 32167, foobar (46px) -2.5`.

- You can increment a number by selecting a part of it.
  Hayaku would increment the whole number based on the context.

  Try in there: `10000, -19999, 3.1415926`

- Hayaku keeps the position of the cursor inside a value, so you won't lose the focus.

- Hayaku perfectly handles multiple cursors.

  Try in by placing multiple cursors at the above examples.

- You can increment multiple lines at once
  (only the first number on each line would be affected)

  Try it selecting both lines in this example:

        -webkit-border-radius: 10px;
                border-radius: 10px;

- You can cycle through values of CSS properties.
  Try this at any stylesheet you have.

- Hayaku is CSS-aware: it would change values from `0` to `1px`,
  it won't reduce paddings less than zero, and have a lot of other small tweaks for CSS.


User-defined dictionaries
-------------------------

If you don't like what any given abbreviation is expaned to,
or if you'd like to use your custom CSS abbreviations, you could do it now.

You can now add your entries to the dictionary Hayaku uses for its abbreviation engine,
or correct any abbreviations Hayaku expands not as you expect.

There are a bunch of options for this, see all of them at the docs:
https://github.com/hayaku/hayaku#user-dictionaries

For example, if you'd like to add a new value for the `position` property, you can do it this way:

    "hayaku_user_dict": [
        {
            "name": "position",
            "values": ["sticky"]
        }
    ]

And if you'd like to have `z` to expand to `z-index` and not to `zoom`, you can do it this way:

    "hayaku_user_aliases": {
        "z": "z-index"
    }
