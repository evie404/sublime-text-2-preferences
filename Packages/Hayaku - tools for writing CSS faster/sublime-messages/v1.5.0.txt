(You may need to restart ST for all Hayaku's features to work properly after update)

User aliases in Hayaku were improved: now it is possible to do things like this:

    "hayaku_user_aliases": {
        "fv": "font:verdana"
    },
    "hayaku_user_dict": {
        "CSS": [
            {
                "name": "font",
                "values": [
                    "11px/1.5 Verdana, sans-serif"
                ]
            }
        ]
    },

this would allow you to both use abbreviations like `fver` or `fonve`,
or to use the `fv` alias that would also be treated as Hayaku abbreviation,
ending in `font: 11px/1.5 Verdana, sans-serif` in all cases.
